# Transcription-Translation

Transcription is a key step in gene expression; it involves copying a DNA sequence to make RNA. This information in the form of RNA is then used to form a protein. As such, I have expanded upon my previous projects to provide the user with the ability to transcribe their unique DNA sequence of interest to produce a RNA strand that could provide useful information for sequence manipulation, protein synthesis and other functional structures.

## Hoping to update with ability for transcribed DNA strand to provide amino acid based on codon.
